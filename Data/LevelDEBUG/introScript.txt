s;Noah;Kalin, Arundel justice is diplomacy.
s;Kalin;That doesn't matter, Noah. It sounded cool!
s;Noah;Also, why did you place enemies to the south and south west?{w}{br}Byrak wouldn't invade from there!
s;Kalin;Because it's supposed to be challenging, duh!{w}{br}That's also why we didn't add the Falcoknight.
s;Noah;It's called realism, Kalin.
s;Kalin;Then why'd you put all those archers in the upper right?
s;Noah;So you couldn't just fly in there.{w}{br}Byrak has archers you know.
s;Kalin;Hmph, fine!
